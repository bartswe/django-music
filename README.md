## :scroll: Project description
This is a recruitment task for a Junior Python Developer position. The task was simple:
to create a Django admin-panel-only website, with two models (Author, Song) with a
many-to-many relationship between them, along with viewing and creating instances of
those models in the admin panel.

The database choice was arbitrary, but with a recommendation of an in-memory version.
While I believe it would make the task easier in for example Java's Spring, in Django it
doesn't. I decided to take the challenge and try to run Django with an in-memory database
only, and I succeeded. Every time the server is shut down, created model instances are
wiped. Every time the server is started, migrations are run and the admin account is
created automatically. I do realise that it is a nonstandard solution, but I still wanted
to try that, since the rest of the task was straightforward.

Besides that, I implemented automated testing in a CI/CD pipeline on SemaphoreCI, along
with dockerization and deployment from a container to Heroku.


## :hammer: Technologies used
- Python 3.9.12
- Django 4.0.5
- Gunicorn 20.1.0
- Docker
- SemaphoreCI
- Heroku


## :hammer_and_wrench: Deployment

A) through Docker:
1. Create an `.env` file basing on `.env_sample_file` from the repository.
2. Run `docker run --env-file .env -p 8020:8020 bsski/django-music:latest` in the `.env` file directory.
3. Access `localhost:8020`. 

B) without Docker:
1. Download the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory of `requirements.txt`.
4. Create an `.env` file basing on `.env_sample_file` from the repository in the directory of `.env_sample_file`.
5. Run `python manage.py runserver --noreload` in the directory of `manage.py`.
6. Access `127.0.0.1:8000`.

The admin panel can be found under your chosen URL or, if you didn't set it in the .env file, the default `/hidden_admin_url`.
Security through obscurity is not enough of course, but I find it a nice complementary solution.


## :closed_lock_with_key: Environment variables

To run this project, you have to set up the following environment variables in the `.env` file (**the values below are exemplary**):
```
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=TestAdminPassword
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=TestAdminName
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=TestAdmin@email.com
SECRET_KEY=TestSecretKey
ADMIN_LOGIN_URL=test_admin_login_url
PORT=8020
```


## :rocket: Features
- two models in a many-to-many relationship (Author, Song),
- django admin panel which enables creating instances of models and viewing them,
- purely in-memory database.

Furthermore, the website is deployed on Heroku from a Docker image using a CI/CD SemaphoreCI pipeline:

## :arrow_up: Room for improvement

Room for improvement:
- QoL features in admin panel could be added, for example sorting.
